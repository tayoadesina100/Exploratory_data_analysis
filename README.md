# Exploratory_data_analysis
**Bank Customer Exploratory Data Analysis Repository**

This repository contains code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank customers. The analysis focuses on variables such as balance, deposit, age, loan status, and more to uncover relationships and patterns within the dataset.

### Files Included:

1. **README.md**: Overview of the repository and instructions on how to navigate through the code and documentation.

2. **bank_customer_eda.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main EDA code. It covers data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis of relationships between variables.

3. **data/**: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.

### Usage:

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the `bank_customer_eda.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.

### Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis is located in the `data/` folder. It contains information about bank customers, including balance, deposit, age, loan status, and other relevant variables.

### Analysis:

The analysis aims to uncover the significance of relationships between important variables in the dataset. It includes:

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Visualization of data distributions, correlations, and trends.
- Analysis of relationships between variables using statistical tests or visual inspection.
- Interpretation of findings to understand the impact of variables on customer behavior or outcomes.

### Results:

The EDA provides insights into the dataset, highlighting significant relationships between variables and potential trends in customer behavior. These insights can inform decision-making in areas such as marketing strategies, product offerings, or risk assessment.
